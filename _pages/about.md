I am currently an Algorithm Engineer at a startup based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Information and Computing Science from South China University of Technology in 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Li (Charlie) Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=e1GOPw0AAAAJ).

- My current work focuses on building robust RAG systems for Agents, bridging the gap between complex unstructured data and actionable insights.
- My research interests also lie in Agent Memory.
- Previously, I focused on Multimodal Learning and LLM Explainability.
